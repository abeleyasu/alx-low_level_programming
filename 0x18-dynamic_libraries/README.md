0x18. C - Dynamic Libraries
Overview
This project delves into the concept of dynamic libraries in the C programming language. It encompasses the understanding of dynamic libraries, their functionality, the process of creating them, and a comparative analysis with static and shared libraries.

Function Prototypes ðŸ’¾
The project includes the following essential files:

Files Description
libdynamic.so C dynamic library containing function definitions.
main.h Header files containing function prototypes.
1-create_dynamic_lib.sh Bash script that creates a dynamic library named liball.so from all the .c files in the current directory.
100-operations.so C dynamic library containing C functions callable from Python.
random.so C dynamic library designed for injection into a large-scale program.
101-make_me_win.sh Bash script facilitating the injection of the libmask.so library into a large program using LD_PRELOAD.
Learning Objectives
Throughout the project, I gained insights into the practical aspects of dynamic libraries, honing skills in their creation, application, and comprehension of their distinctions from static and shared libraries.

Usage
To utilize the dynamic libraries created in this project, refer to the corresponding scripts and library files for integration into C and Python programs.

For detailed instructions on library creation, refer to the 1-create_dynamic_lib.sh script.

Acknowledgments
This project has enhanced my understanding of dynamic libraries, contributing to a more comprehensive knowledge of C programming and software development.
